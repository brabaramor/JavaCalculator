# JavaCalculator

<strong>Hello!</strong>
<p>
First of all: this is just a try to develop a simple calculator in Java.
<br>
To help me in the process, I'm reading articles and tutorials. I'll put the ABNT references to the articles at the end.

<h2> The idea </h2>

<p>So my idea it's to build a GUI (graphic user interface) calculator with the four basic arithmetics operations, like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
<br> As it is a GUI calculator, the user will not type the number, but click on it. </p>

<h2> About it</h2>

<p> I'm using NetBeans and Java to do it. Actually, this is my first attempt with Netbeans so I'm racking my brain a little bit 😆 </p>
<ol>
  <li>I started doing the Java codes for a no GUI calculator, but it's not ready yet ⏳ ;</li>
  <li> Based on The Genius Blog (2017), I did these steps on NetBeans:
      <ul> 
        <li> a) Creating Java Application (I choose Maven); </li>
        <li> b) Creating JFrame; </li>
        <li> c) Personalizing the interface (I choose 💜purple and pink, but I still want to upgrade the personalization at all); </li>
        <li> d) Place and rename the buttons and the panel with the text field. Them, change its variable names; </li>
        <li> e) Then I created three variables (static int value1; static int value2; static String operator) to start coding; </li>
        <li> f) So I did the codes for the click event on the buttons (the codes itself it's available in the java calculator class file);</li>
        <li> g) Finally, I did a lot of tests! And it's running perfectly! </li>
      </ul>    
  </li>
</ol>
<p> Of course there's a lot to progress, it's my first program, but it made me learn a lot! I feel confident to try some more complex program! </p>
<p> Anyway, the result of the GUI purple-pink calculator with NetBeans was... </p>

<p> Pretty cute, right? 😸 💜</p>
<p> For now, that's it!</p>
