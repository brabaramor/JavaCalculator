# JavaCalculator

<strong>Hello!</strong>
<p>
First of all: this is just a try to develop a simple calculator in Java.
<br>
To help me in the process, I'm reading articles and tutorials. I'll put the ABNT references to the articles at the end.

<h2> The idea </h2>

<p>So my idea it's to build a GUI (graphic user interface) calculator with the four basic arithmetics operations, like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
<br> As it is a GUI calculator, the user will not type the number, but click on it. </p>

<h2> About it</h2>

<p> I'm using NetBeans and Java to do it. Actually, this is my first attempt with Netbeans so I'm racking my brain a little bit ðŸ˜† </p>
<ol>
  <li>I started doing the Java codes for the buttons and stuff, because that's the part that I already know how to do it; </li>
  <li> After I'll build the GUI with NetBeans.</li>
  <li> [...] </li>
</ol>
